      more: `<p>Water is an abundant resource on our planet, existing not only in vast bodies like oceans and lakes but also in the air we breathe. </p> <p>While land-based water sources are finite and often subject to depletion, the atmosphere holds a considerable reservoir of untapped moisture. </p> In fact, it's estimated that the Earth's atmosphere contains around 13,000 cubic kilometres of water vapor at any given time, far surpassing the volume of freshwater found in rivers and lakes combined. </p>
      <p> Atmospheric water generation emerges as a crucial solution in harnessing this immense yet overlooked resource. </p> <p>By leveraging innovative technologies like Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs), atmospheric water generation systems can extract water from even the driest of environments, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional water sources. </p> <p> As we confront the challenges of climate change and water scarcity, the role of atmospheric water generation in securing clean, accessible water for communities worldwide will only continue to grow, providing a vital lifeline for future generations. </p>
      <p> Welcome to NovNat Tech, where innovation meets sustainability. Our team has pioneered groundbreaking Metal Organic Framework (MOF) materials,
      meticulously designed for use in large-scale atmospheric water generation systems.

      more: `<p>Porous materials play a pivotal role in addressing world-scale challenges such as carbon capture and water scarcity by virtue of their unique structural properties. </p> <p>These materials possess a network of pores and channels, offering a large surface area for interactions with gases and liquids. Among the diverse array of porous materials, Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as particularly promising candidates.</p> <p>MOFs are composed of metal ions or clusters linked by organic ligands, resulting in highly porous structures with tuneable properties.
      MOFs are a unique class of nano porous materials with unprecedented functional and chemical control, making them highly versatile for use in many applications including harvesting water from air.</p>
      <p>In the realm of water scarcity, MOFs hold immense potential for atmospheric water generation (AWG) systems. These materials excel in adsorbing water vapor from the air, even in low-humidity environments, making them invaluable for harvesting water in arid regions and mitigating water shortages.
      By acting as nano-scale selective sponges, MOFs can selectively capture water molecules while excluding impurities, ensuring the quality and purity of the harvested water.</p>
      <p>NovNat Tech's MOF materials excel in water vapor extraction, operating at remarkable capacities and speeds.
      Acting as a nano-scale selective sponge, they exclusively bond with airborne water molecules, ensuring the purity of captured water remains untainted by impurities.
      What sets our patented MOFs apart is their unparalleled ability to harvest water even in environments with humidity levels as low as 10%, making them adaptable worldwide,
      from arid deserts to humid climates. With a water capacity of up to 60% of their weight, they are game-changers in water resource management.</p>
      <p>Moreover, our MOFs are crafted from abundant, easily recyclable metals and organic linkers,
      synthesized using water alone. This eco-friendly manufacturing process is not only sustainable but also highly scalable,
      ensuring minimal environmental impact as we expand our operations.
      Additionally, due to our MOFs being highly affinitive to water, the water generated is completely pure H2O!</p>

      NovNat's AWG technology is powered by cutting edge sorbent materials (Metal Organic Frameworks- MOFs).
      Upon being exposed to moisture in the air, our MOFs capture (adsorb) the moisture utilising their high capacities (60wt%) and facile kinetics (saturation @90%RH in 15mins).
      Subsequently, the desorption process is initiated by passing a heated working fluid through the adsorbent heat exchangers transferring the heat to the coated MOF material causing it to release the captured vapour which is then transferred to the condenser chamber.
      Here, the vapour condenses and becomes pure liquid water that can be directly injected to point of need (distilled water) or mineralised if potability is required.`,

      details: `One of the primary challenges MOFs face in reaching commercialization is scalability. While
      MOFs exhibit remarkable properties in the lab, scaling up their production to meet industrial
      demands can be complex and costly. At NovNat Tech, we&#39;re tackling this challenge through a
      combination of innovative and green synthesis techniques, process optimization, and strategic
      partnerships with industry leaders in materials science and manufacturing. By leveraging our
      expertise and collaborating with key stakeholders, we&#39;re working towards overcoming
      scalability hurdles and bringing MOF-based technologies to market efficiently and cost-
      effectively. Another challenge is the way in which they are integrated with various systems
      whether that is atmospheric water generation systems in our case or others such as desiccant
      dehumidifiers. This is what we refer to as shaping or form factor and is a critical step in
      ensuring seamless integration without performance losses. At NovNat we have developed
      unique form factors allowing us to integrate our MOFs with our AWG systems and are
      working with clients to demonstrate integration with other systems such as desiccant rotors
      and adsorption heat pumps.`,

    The UN estimates that by 2030, intense water scarcity could displace around 700 million people and,
    by 2025, half of the world's population could be living in areas facing water scarcity. The inevitable global water shortage due to increased usage and climate change, has caused many governments, institutions, organisations and industrial corporations around the world to investigate alternative sources of water. In this regard, NovNat Tech has invented a novel Multivariant Metal Organic Framework material capable of
    extracting water from air in any environment around the world,
    significantly reducing energy usage and fully eliminating carbon emissions from the water production process.
    The founding team utilised this project to investigate and develop an atmospheric water generation device
    for rescue and military vehicles utilizing the waste heat to drive the water generation process,
    with the vision of commercialising the product in the UK and across the globe to provide
    an alternative sustainable source of water. The system has been developed to Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5 with a water production of 15L per day.
    The UK government provided funding for this project, which has since been successfully completed.
    NovNat is currently in the process of scaling the system to achieve a higher TRL with the aim of reaching
    a commercial productby 2027.` },

        The aim is to identify and provide support to scalable start-ups where Bupa contribution can enhance their sustainability solutions.
        NovNat was chosen from among two Bupa Global & UK start-ups advancing to the global finalâa thrilling talent program empowering emerging eco-entrepreneurs on Bupa's path towards achieving our net zero targets.
        NovNat has spearheaded a revolutionary technology capable of extracting water from the air, presenting a solution to the severe water scarcity afflicting numerous communities worldwide. Partnering with Bupa, NovNat aims to address water challenges within their global facilities and structures, which are adversely affected by water shortages. NovNat conducted site visits to various Bupa buildings in the UK to explore the feasibility of harnessing waste heat within the buildings to convert it into pure water, as well as utilizing our system as a dehumidification solution. `

This focus is particularly crucial for regions grappling with water scarcity induced by climate change, which has now extended to parts of Europe such as Spain and Italy.
    NovNat is poised to address this challenge by proposing a circular economy solution.
    Given that many food production systems consume significant amounts of water while also generating substantial waste heat,
    NovNat aims to leverage this excess heat to produce water. Through this innovative approach,
     not only can we achieve a net-zero water vision,
    but we can also contribute positively to the environment.` },
