      more: `<p>Water is an abundant resource on our planet, existing not only in vast bodies like oceans and lakes but also in the air we breathe. </p> <p>While land-based water sources are finite and often subject to depletion, the atmosphere holds a considerable reservoir of untapped moisture. </p> In fact, it's estimated that the Earth's atmosphere contains around 13,000 cubic kilometres of water vapor at any given time, far surpassing the volume of freshwater found in rivers and lakes combined. </p>
      <p> Atmospheric water generation emerges as a crucial solution in harnessing this immense yet overlooked resource. </p> <p>By leveraging innovative technologies like Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs), atmospheric water generation systems can extract water from even the driest of environments, offering a sustainable alternative to traditional water sources. </p> <p> As we confront the challenges of climate change and water scarcity, the role of atmospheric water generation in securing clean, accessible water for communities worldwide will only continue to grow, providing a vital lifeline for future generations. </p>

      more: `<p>Porous materials play a pivotal role in addressing world-scale challenges such as carbon capture and water scarcity by virtue of their unique structural properties. </p> <p>These materials possess a network of pores and channels, offering a large surface area for interactions with gases and liquids. Among the diverse array of porous materials, Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs) have emerged as particularly promising candidates.</p> <p>MOFs are composed of metal ions or clusters linked by organic ligands, resulting in highly porous structures with tuneable properties.
      MOFs are a unique class of nano porous materials with unprecedented functional and chemical control, making them highly versatile for use in many applications including harvesting water from air.</p>
      <p>In the realm of water scarcity, MOFs hold immense potential for atmospheric water generation (AWG) systems. These materials excel in adsorbing water vapor from the air, even in low-humidity environments, making them invaluable for harvesting water in arid regions and mitigating water shortages.
      By acting as nano-scale selective sponges, MOFs can selectively capture water molecules while excluding impurities, ensuring the quality and purity of the harvested water.</p>
      <p>NovNat Tech's MOF materials excel in water vapor extraction, operating at remarkable capacities and speeds.
      Acting as a nano-scale selective sponge, they exclusively bond with airborne water molecules, ensuring the purity of captured water remains untainted by impurities.
      What sets our patented MOFs apart is their unparalleled ability to harvest water even in environments with humidity levels as low as 10%, making them adaptable worldwide,
      from arid deserts to humid climates. With a water capacity of up to 60% of their weight, they are game-changers in water resource management.</p>
      <p>Moreover, our MOFs are crafted from abundant, easily recyclable metals and organic linkers,
      synthesized using water alone. This eco-friendly manufacturing process is not only sustainable but also highly scalable,
      ensuring minimal environmental impact as we expand our operations.
      Additionally, due to our MOFs being highly affinitive to water, the water generated is completely pure H2O!</p>

      Upon being exposed to moisture in the air, our MOFs capture (adsorb) the moisture utilising their high capacities (60wt%) and facile kinetics (saturation @90%RH in 15mins).
      Subsequently, the desorption process is initiated by passing a heated working fluid through the adsorbent heat exchangers transferring the heat to the coated MOF material causing it to release the captured vapour which is then transferred to the condenser chamber.
      Here, the vapour condenses and becomes pure liquid water that can be directly injected to point of need (distilled water) or mineralised if potability is required.`,

The enhanced heat transfer has been achieved by developing a coating technique of the MOF material on the heat exchanger surface, to ensure having a uniform temperature distribution along multiple heat exchangers in the unit. A good mass transfer is also achieved in the unit after introducing air channels across the heat exchanger to equally distribute the air through the MOF with minimum pressure drop, which is also helps in scaling up the system.',

      details: `Yes, our system produces water that meets the standard water quality requirements for drinking water,

        This is achieved through our MOF material which acts as a 'nano- scale selective sponge' and 'filter' simultaneously,
         producing ultra-pure water that is safe for consumption. The MOF is engineered to bond only with water molecules in the air,
          and the internal structure of the MOF acts as a filter, producing water that meets or exceeds all water safety requirements.
          Water molecules have a stronger bonding affinity with the adsorption sites in the pore compared to other pollutants such as carbon dioxide, NOx, SOx, methane, ammonia, and hydrogen sulfide,
          which may potentially be adsorbed by the MOF. This selectivity phenomenon ensures that only water molecules occupy the pore volume and are subsequently desorbed from the MOF.
          In contrast, other AWG systems that use desiccants such as zeolite, silica gel, or glycerol, or liquid desiccants such as brine,
          do not possess the same size exclusion and selectivity properties as our MOF, and may require additional filtration steps to achieve the same level of water purity.
          Similarly, refrigeration-based AWG systems capture all pollutants in the water vapor and must be filtered out,
          resulting in water of lower quality. Additionally, we conduct regular testing and quality control measures to ensure that the water produced by our system is safe for consumption and meets safety standards.

          `To make MOF-based CO2-sensors (Matrix Sensors):
        Preliminary studies on our system in terms of commercial feasibility show that although there is a significant up-front cost to purchasing a working system to produce water using AWG, the benefits gained in return are significant. Firstly, the system can produce water at a faster rate than any other known MOFs based device currently known. Secondly, the nature of our company-patented MOF results in the least amount of thermal energy required to deliver the water which translates to low running costs of the system. Last but not least, the system we have developed requires a relatively small amount of space, making it suitable for both industrial and household applications, where it can be placed on empty roof spaces.`
