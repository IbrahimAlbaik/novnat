This can be managed by the novel approach that NovNat Tech has developed in optimizing the heat and mass transfer inside the chamber. The enhanced heat transfer has been achieved by developing a coating technique of the MOF material on the heat exchanger surface, to ensure having a uniform temperature distribution along multiple heat exchangers in the unit. A good mass transfer is also achieved in the unit after introducing air channels across the heat exchanger to equally distribute the air through the MOF with minimum pressure drop, which is also helps in scaling up the system.",features:[]},{id:d,title:"Q3.

Does your system meet drinking water regulatory standards?",details:"Yes, our system produces water that meets the standard water quality requirements for drinking water,\n       with a pH range of 6.5-9.5.\n        This is achieved through our MOF material which acts as a 'nano- scale selective sponge' and 'filter' simultaneously,\n         producing ultra-pure water that is safe for consumption. The MOF is engineered to bond only with water molecules in the air,\n          and the internal structure of the MOF acts as a filter, producing water that meets or exceeds all water safety requirements.\n          Water molecules have a stronger bonding affinity with the adsorption sites in the pore compared to other pollutants such as carbon dioxide, NOx, SOx, methane, ammonia, and hydrogen sulfide,\n          which may potentially be adsorbed by the MOF. This selectivity phenomenon ensures that only water molecules occupy the pore volume and are subsequently desorbed from the MOF.\n          In contrast, other AWG systems that use desiccants such as zeolite, silica gel, or glycerol, or liquid desiccants such as brine,\n          do not possess the same size exclusion and selectivity properties as our MOF, and may require additional filtration steps to achieve the same level of water purity.\n          Similarly, refrigeration-based AWG systems capture all pollutants in the water vapor and must be filtered out,\n          resulting in water of lower quality. Additionally, we conduct regular testing and quality control measures to ensure that the water produced by our system is safe for consumption and meets safety standards.\n          NovNat Tech is also engaged with the EPA in the US to investigate microbial water quality of the produced water to ensure the AWG system maintains the required standard throughout its lifetime.",features:[]},{id:6,title:"Q6: What distinguishes our company-patented MOF from others and why is our MOF expected to achieve commercial success in the field of AWG?",details:"Our company-patented MOF, Nov-1,\n      demonstrates superior performance compared to existing technologies for AWG,\n      including the current leading structure MOF-303, as well as other conventional methods (see Table 2 1and Table 2 2).
